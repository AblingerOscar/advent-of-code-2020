# Notes on the implementation of day 7

This challenge was pretty rough.
And of course it is the first challenge where I decided I want to try my great regex-based-string-parsing idea that I had.
That should also explain the overly complicated way of parsing the input.

I don't know yet what I think of it, but I'll likely experiment around a bit more with the regex-based parser in the future.
