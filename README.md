# Advent of code 2020

In this repository, all of my implementations used to solve the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) challenges can be found.

In order to learn more from it, I decided to implement all of them in a new language that I've never done much with, but was interested in learning for a long time: **F#**

Note that while the challenges generally demand a certain amount of efficiency, the focus is not on that, but rather on either idomatic F# or just trying out different features of it â€“ even those that aren't efficient or idiomatic.
